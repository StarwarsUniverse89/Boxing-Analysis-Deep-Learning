# Boxing Analysis with Deep Learning ðŸ¥Š

This project uses deep learning to analyze and predict the movements of a famous boxer in the ring. The goal is to create detailed visualizations and gain strategic insights into the boxer's behavior. This project is only a template that has potential higher quality processed frames from video footage is required or another source. The current source is youtube. 

## Key Features ðŸ’¡

- **Advanced Detection**: Utilizes YOLO models to accurately detect the boxer in each frame, capturing precise movement patterns.
- **Dynamic Label Mapping**: Flexible system to handle various data structures, improving scalability.
- **Augmented Training Data**: Enhances model robustness with techniques like rotation and scaling.
- **Movement Analysis**: Tracks the boxer's position in the ring to create heatmaps and 3D models revealing preferred fighting zones and movement tendencies.
- **Opponent Comparison**: Compares movement patterns with different opponents to gain strategic insights.

## What's Next? ðŸŒŸ
1. **Opponent Comparison**: Compares movement patterns with different opponents to gain strategic insights.
2. **Enhancing Strike Detection**: Refine the model to analyze specific striking patterns for a comprehensive view of strategies.
3. **Real-Time Tracking**: Develop tools for live match feedback, revolutionizing training and strategy.
4. **Opponent Analysis**: Explore how different opponents influence movement and striking patterns.

## Lack of Existing Research ðŸ“š

Surprisingly, thereâ€™s little research on using deep learning for boxer movement analysis. Most work focuses on:
- **Player Re-identification**: Tracking players in crowded scenes.
- **Movement and Pose Estimation**: Applied to improve actions and strategies in sports.
- **3D Player Tracking**: Creating 3D maps of player positions for strategic decisions.

## Future Potential ðŸš€

- **Ring IQ Metric**: Quantify strategic intelligence based on movement, striking accuracy, and defense.
- **Comparative Ontology**: Visualize the evolution of boxing strategies across eras.
- **Broader Sports Applications**: Apply these methods to other sports for comprehensive player analysis.
